        <h2>Jabberwocky</h2>
        <h3>by Lewis Carroll</h3>
        <pre>
            'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

                Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

            All mimsy were the borogoves,

                And the mome raths outgrabe.

 

            <i><b>"Beware the <span style="color: red;">Jabberwock</span>, my son!

                 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!

            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

                The frumious Bandersnatch!"</b></i>

 

            He took his vorpal sword in hand;

                 Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”

            So rested he by the Tumtum tree

                 And stood awhile in thought.
